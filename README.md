## Model Details
### Summarization and Topic Extraction
- Uses an OpenAI LLM model to extract key topics and summarize articles.
- Ensures valid JSON response parsing from LLM output.

### Sentiment Analysis
- Uses `TextBlob` to analyze sentiment.
- Classifies sentiment as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.

### Comparative Analysis
- Compares sentiment across articles.
- Extracts key differences and common themes.

### Final Analysis
- Summarizes overall sentiment across all articles.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Uses `gTTS` to generate Hindi speech for the final sentiment analysis.

### **GET /analyze-company-news**
Streams processed data, including:
- News fetching status
- Processed articles (title, summary, topics, sentiment)
- Comparative sentiment analysis
- Final sentiment assessment
- Hindi audio file URL

#### Example Request:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/analyze-company-news?company=Tesla"
```
#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "articles": [
    {
